## Responsive Layout & Mobile Design

### Mobile-First Approach
InkManager Pro uses a mobile-first responsive design that adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes:

- **Mobile (≤768px)**: Bottom tab navigation with off-canvas sidebar
- **Desktop (>768px)**: Side navigation with collapsible sidebar option

### Key Responsive Features

#### Dynamic Viewport Heights
- Uses `100dvh` (dynamic viewport height) with `100vh` fallback
- Handles mobile browser chrome (address bar) appearing/disappearing on iOS Safari and Chrome Android
- Prevents content from being pushed below viewport when browser chrome changes

#### Bottom Tab Bar
- Fixed position at viewport bottom with `z-index: 1100`
- Height managed by CSS variable `--tab-bar-height: 64px`
- Safe-area inset padding: `padding-bottom: max(env(safe-area-inset-bottom), 8px)`
- Prevents overlap with content via calculated padding on `.app-container`

#### Z-Index Hierarchy
Layer stacking ensures proper element visibility:
- Sidebar: `1000`
- Mobile sidebar overlay: `1000`
- Mobile sidebar (when open): `1001`
- Bottom tab navigation: `1100`
- Install prompt / Update banner: `1150`
- Modals: `1200`

#### Safe Area Support
- Respects iOS notches and Android navigation gestures
- Uses `env(safe-area-inset-*)` for proper padding
- Viewport meta tag includes `viewport-fit=cover`

#### Testing Viewports
The app is tested and optimized for these common mobile widths:
- 360px (small Android phones)
- 375px (iPhone SE, iPhone 12/13 mini)
- 390px (iPhone 12/13/14)
- 414px (iPhone Plus models)
- 430px (iPhone 14 Pro Max)
- Landscape orientations

## Storage Versioning

InkManager Pro uses a versioned storage system to safely evolve saved data without user data loss.

### How It Works

- **Version Key**: `inkmanager_storage_version` tracks the current storage schema version
- **Automatic Migration**: On app startup, the storage system detects the current version and runs necessary migrations
- **Idempotent Migrations**: All migrations are safe to run multiple times without data corruption
- **User Notification**: When migrations run, users see a dismissible banner confirming the successful upgrade

### Current Storage Version

The current storage version is **v3**. The storage module handles three migration paths:

- **v0 → v1**: Initialize storage with default settings and empty data arrays
- **v1 → v2**: Add notification tracking and inventory filter/sort defaults
- **v2 → v3**: Add sidebar state and perform data integrity checks

### Adding a New Migration

To add a new migration:

1. Open `assets/js/modules/storage.js`
2. Increment the `CURRENT_VERSION` constant
3. Add a new migration object to the `migrations` array:

```javascript
{
    version: 4,  // Next version number
    description: 'Brief description of what this migration does',
    up: function() {
        console.log('📦 Running migration v3 → v4: Your description');
        
        // Your migration code here
        // Always check if data exists before creating (idempotent)
        if (!getData('inkmanager_newFeature')) {
            setData('inkmanager_newFeature', defaultValue);
            console.log('  ✓ Added new feature data');
        }
        
        console.log('✅ Migration v3 → v4 complete');
    }
}
```

4. Test the migration using `tests/storage-migration.html`

### Important Guidelines

- **Always make migrations idempotent**: Check if data exists before creating/modifying it
- **Never delete user data**: Only add or transform data, never remove it unless explicitly migrating away from deprecated fields
- **Test thoroughly**: Use the test page to verify migrations work correctly
- **Document changes**: Update this README when adding new migrations

### Testing Migrations

Open `tests/storage-migration.html` in your browser to:

- Simulate different storage versions
- Run automated migration tests
- Verify data integrity and idempotence
- View current storage state

The test page includes automated tests that verify:
- Migrations from each version work correctly
- Data is preserved (no data loss)
- Migrations are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

## Development
The app consists of:
- `index.html` - Main application with inline CSS and core JavaScript
- `assets/app.js` - PWA install, mobile menu, routing, and UI interactions
- `assets/js/modules/storage.js` - Versioned storage management and migrations
- `assets/js/modules/ui.js` - UI components (migration banners, etc.)
- `manifest.json` - PWA configuration
- `sw.js` - Service worker for offline functionality and notifications
- `tests/storage-migration.html` - Storage migration test suite

### Contributing to Accessibility

We welcome contributions to improve accessibility! When contributing:

1. **Test with keyboard only** - Ensure all features are accessible without a mouse
2. **Use semantic HTML** - Choose the right HTML element for the job
3. **Add ARIA when needed** - Use ARIA attributes to enhance semantics when HTML alone isn't sufficient
4. **Maintain focus styles** - Never remove focus outlines without providing an alternative
5. **Test with screen readers** - Verify changes work with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
6. **Check color contrast** - Ensure text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
7. **Document changes** - Update this section when adding accessibility features

### Known Limitations

- Some third-party icon fonts may not be optimally labeled
- Calendar navigation could be enhanced with arrow key support
- Drag-and-drop features are not yet keyboard accessible
