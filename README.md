## Browser Support
- ✅ Chrome/Edge 90+ (Full notification support)
- ✅ Firefox 88+ (Full notification support)
- ✅ Safari 14+ (Notification support may vary)
- ✅ Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Chrome Android)

**Note:** Notification features require browser permission and may not be available in all browsers or configurations.

## Storage Versioning

InkManager Pro uses a versioned storage system to safely evolve saved data without user data loss.

### How It Works

- **Version Key**: `inkmanager_storage_version` tracks the current storage schema version
- **Automatic Migration**: On app startup, the storage system detects the current version and runs necessary migrations
- **Idempotent Migrations**: All migrations are safe to run multiple times without data corruption
- **User Notification**: When migrations run, users see a dismissible banner confirming the successful upgrade

### Current Storage Version

The current storage version is **v3**. The storage module handles three migration paths:

- **v0 → v1**: Initialize storage with default settings and empty data arrays
- **v1 → v2**: Add notification tracking and inventory filter/sort defaults
- **v2 → v3**: Add sidebar state and perform data integrity checks

### Adding a New Migration

To add a new migration:

1. Open `assets/js/modules/storage.js`
2. Increment the `CURRENT_VERSION` constant
3. Add a new migration object to the `migrations` array:

```javascript
{
    version: 4,  // Next version number
    description: 'Brief description of what this migration does',
    up: function() {
        console.log('📦 Running migration v3 → v4: Your description');
        
        // Your migration code here
        // Always check if data exists before creating (idempotent)
        if (!getData('inkmanager_newFeature')) {
            setData('inkmanager_newFeature', defaultValue);
            console.log('  ✓ Added new feature data');
        }
        
        console.log('✅ Migration v3 → v4 complete');
    }
}
```

4. Test the migration using `tests/storage-migration.html`

### Important Guidelines

- **Always make migrations idempotent**: Check if data exists before creating/modifying it
- **Never delete user data**: Only add or transform data, never remove it unless explicitly migrating away from deprecated fields
- **Test thoroughly**: Use the test page to verify migrations work correctly
- **Document changes**: Update this README when adding new migrations

### Testing Migrations

Open `tests/storage-migration.html` in your browser to:

- Simulate different storage versions
- Run automated migration tests
- Verify data integrity and idempotence
- View current storage state

The test page includes automated tests that verify:
- Migrations from each version work correctly
- Data is preserved (no data loss)
- Migrations are idempotent (safe to run multiple times)

## Development
The app consists of:
- `index.html` - Main application with inline CSS and core JavaScript
- `assets/app.js` - PWA install, mobile menu, routing, and UI interactions
- `assets/js/modules/storage.js` - Versioned storage management and migrations
- `assets/js/modules/ui.js` - UI components (migration banners, etc.)
- `manifest.json` - PWA configuration
- `sw.js` - Service worker for offline functionality and notifications
- `tests/storage-migration.html` - Storage migration test suite

### Screen Reader Support

The app has been optimized for screen readers with:
- Descriptive ARIA labels on all navigation elements
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1-h4) for document structure

### Contributing to Accessibility

We welcome contributions to improve accessibility! When contributing:

1. **Test with keyboard only** - Ensure all features are accessible without a mouse
2. **Use semantic HTML** - Choose the right HTML element for the job
3. **Add ARIA when needed** - Use ARIA attributes to enhance semantics when HTML alone isn't sufficient
4. **Maintain focus styles** - Never remove focus outlines without providing an alternative
5. **Test with screen readers** - Verify changes work with NVDA, JAWS, or VoiceOver
6. **Check color contrast** - Ensure text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
7. **Document changes** - Update this section when adding accessibility features

### Known Limitations

- Some third-party icon fonts may not be optimally labeled
- Calendar navigation could be enhanced with arrow key support
- Drag-and-drop features are not yet keyboard accessible

## Troubleshooting

### App appears frozen or won't load

1. **Clear browser cache and reload:**
   - Chrome/Edge: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete` (or `Cmd+Shift+Delete` on Mac), select "Cached images and files", then click "Clear data"
   - Firefox: Press `Ctrl+Shift+Delete`, select "Cache", then click "Clear Now"
   - Safari: Go to Preferences > Privacy > Manage Website Data, search for the site, and click "Remove"

5. **Verify you're using a supported browser:**
   - Chrome 90+, Edge 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+

### Data not saving
- Ensure your browser allows localStorage
- Check that you're not in private/incognito mode (data won't persist)
- Verify you have sufficient storage space

### Notifications not working
- Allow notification permissions when prompted
- Check browser notification settings
- Test notifications using the "Test Notifications" button in Settings
